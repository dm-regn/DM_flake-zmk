# Anywhy Flake Based

starting off with Flake-M as offered.

successfully added a n!n_v2 with 1.3" oled display as central dongle with the flake-m now acting as peripherals. 
using [englmaxi](https://github.com/englmaxi/zmk-dongle-display) for dongle stuff. 

seems stable, it's been up and running without issues. 
next steps:
- wire in battery with rocker switch
- wire in bootloader / reset momentary switch
- design and print dongle case (adjustable tilt for display, magnet accommodations)
- design and print new cases for peripherals (add in tenting, bigger battery, magnet accommodations)
