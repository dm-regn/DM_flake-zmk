# Anywhy Flake Based

starting off with Flake-M as offered.

successfully added a n!n_v2 with 1.3" oled display as central dongle with the flake-m now acting as peripherals. 
using [englmaxi](https://github.com/englmaxi/zmk-dongle-display) for dongle stuff. 

seems stable, it compiled without issues. Just need to flash devices to test.
